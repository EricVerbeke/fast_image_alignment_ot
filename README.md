## Fast alignment of heterogeneous images in sliced Wasserstein distance

![My Image](Figures/demo.png)

We present a fast algorithm for computing the sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between two images. This can be used for the rotational alignment of two $$L \times L$$ images in $$O(L^2 \log L)$$ operations. Our algorithm is shown to be robust to rotations, translations and deformations in the images.

See https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.13756 for more details about the algorithm.
